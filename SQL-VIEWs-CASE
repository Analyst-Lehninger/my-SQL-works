# here we use VIEWs to limit access to the database

Prompt Part 1/2: Create a "TopCustomers" view  using the following SELECT statement to populate the view
# my code
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS TopCustomers;
Create view topcustomers AS
	SELECT companyname, sum (unitprice * quantity) AS “Total Sales”
	FROM customers C JOIN orders O ON c.customerid = O.customerid
		JOIN orderdetails D ON o.orderid = d.orderid
	GROUP BY companyname
	ORDER BY 2 desc LIMIT 5;

Prompt Part 2/2: Run a Query Against Your View to ensure that it works
SELECT * FROM TopCustomers


Prompt: Create your view, adding a CASE expression.  Add a third column to your view called “Assessment”.
Set the Assessment column equal to “Needs Focus”. if the customer’s total sales is less than $60,000
Set the Assessment column equal to “Average”. if the customer’s total sales is greater than or equal to $60,000 but less than $115,000.
Otherwise set the Assessment column equal to “Outstanding” if the customer’s total sales is greater than or equal to $115,000.
Run a Query Against Your View to see the CASE results.

# my code
DROP VIEW IF ExISTS TopCustomers;

CREATE VIEW Topcustomers AS
	SELECT companyname, sum(unitprice * quantity) AS “Total Sales”,
		CASE
			WHEN sum(unitprice * quantity) < 60000 THEN ‘Needs Focus’
			WHEN sum(unitprice * quantity) < 115000 THEN ‘Average’
			WHEN sum(unitprice * quantity > 115000 THEN ‘Outstanding’
		END Assessment
	
FROM customers C JOIN orders O ON c.customerid = O.customerid
